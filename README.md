<!-- 
This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers about university disciplinary policies by extracting information directly from official PDF documents. It ensures total reliability by citing specific clauses and strictly grounding its responses in the retrieved text to eliminate hallucinations or invented facts.

## 🔍 What It Does

This project builds an AI assistant that answers questions about university disciplinary policies using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Instead of guessing or making up information, it:

✅ Finds **exact relevant rules** from the official PDF document  
✅ Cites **specific sections/clauses** used to answer your question  
✅ Generates answers **strictly from retrieved text** — never invents facts  

### Example Interaction
> **User asks:**  
> *"What are 'unfair or illegal means' in examinations?"*
>
> **System responds:**  
> *"According to Section 5.2 of the EWU Disciplinary Code, unfair or illegal means include:  
> (a) Bringing unauthorized materials into the examination hall  
> (b) Copying from another student's answer script  
> (c) Using programmable calculators or mobile phones  
> (d) Communicating with other students during examination"*  
>   
> *Source: Section 5, Clause 5.2*
